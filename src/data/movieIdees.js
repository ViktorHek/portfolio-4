      <h3>Frankfurt am Main</h3>
      <p>
        The movie's protagonist is an immigrant from Yugoslavia, residing in Gothenburg. Most of the
        characters in the movie speak swedish but the protagonist can never understand them. He
        speaks serbo-croatian, serbian, slovenian, croatian, macedonian, bosnian, albanian,
        hungarian, romanian, italian, german but not swedish. Getting by is difficult but he manages
        it through a combination of hand signals and deep eye contact. The movie takes place in a
        world where 20% of the population has varying superpowers. The protagonist has the power to
        temporarily freeze time, he is called Mr. Freeze2. About 20 minutes into the movie Freeze2
        travels to Frankfurt for a battle with his rival. As soon as they meet Freeze2 uses one of
        his ultimate attacks. During a time freeze, Freeze2 can apply pressure to a flying object
        which will accumulate power to a devastating effect. The attack hits and takes out a whole
        street with it. But it's not enough to defeat the rival. We cut to the destroyed buildings
        and see a girl crying over two corpses. The rest of the movie is about Niam Amo and her
        journey to live a life without her parents. It's not a good life but it's worth living.

      <h3>Colorman</h3>
      <p>
        One faithful day our protagonist, Kodak Láplace, falls into a tank of radioactive paint.
        Later that day he realized he could change the color of his skin. With his newfound
        superhuman ability, he put on a cool fit and went out to town, trying to save the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The town is quiet. Kodak Láplace sees a hodded figure steal a dog from the local dog park
        where he usually lay on the ground playing with dogs. He instinctively changed color to
        black and ran towards the thief. The dog fought with all his might severely limiting the
        thief's movement. But Kodak Láplace was too slow and the thief got away. A month went by,
        Kodak Láplace turned yellow and did an IQ test. The result was the same as months ago. Even
        more months went by, Kodak Láplace didn't know what to eat. He changed his color to brown
        and made "pyttipanna". With a pre-greased frying pan, he chopped up potatoes from two days
        ago, one onion with a cut, four sausages, salt and pepper. No other seasoning. It tasted
        okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kodak Láplace kept on trying to save the world, using his superhuman ability. The only thing
        driving him was a dream to be like Captain Hindsight (Marvel is canon). He trained hard and
        improved his ability. Now being able to develop vitiligo and even split his color right down
        the middle. Even more months than before went by and Kodal Láplace got a job handling move
        props. He was among the best in the business because he was able to turn parts of himself
        green.
      </p>
      <p>End.</p>
      <p>The role of Kodak Láplace is played by Jaden Smith</p>

      <h3>What happens when Google crash?</h3>
      <p>
        The movie plays out in a dystopian future where we are so dependent on tech companies so
        when Google crash due to an earthquake, we get to follow how the world slowly ends. I want
        it to be a slow movie with a dramatic end. You follow one the main character, who lost all
        the money he had in his Google account. He lost his job because the company uses Google for
        day-to-day operations. The book he wrote, his photo album and all other Google-document
        where deleted. The viewer sees how this one event ruined the life of an individual. The
        movie ends with us zooming out and seeing that this is not the case for just the main
        character, but every single person in the movie has it just as bad, if not worse.
      </p>
      <p>The movie ends without a happy ending.</p>
