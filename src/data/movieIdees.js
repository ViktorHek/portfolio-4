      <h3>What happens when Google crash?</h3>
      <p>
        The movie plays out in a dystopian future where we are so dependent on tech companies so
        when Google crash due to an earthquake, we get to follow how the world slowly ends. I want
        it to be a slow movie with a dramatic end. You follow one the main character, who lost all
        the money he had in his Google account. He lost his job because the company uses Google for
        day-to-day operations. The book he wrote, his photo album and all other Google-document
        where deleted. The viewer sees how this one event ruined the life of an individual. The
        movie ends with us zooming out and seeing that this is not the case for just the main
        character, but every single person in the movie has it just as bad, if not worse.

      <p>The movie ends without a happy ending.</p>
