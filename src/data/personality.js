        I'm a simple man with simple needs. I like programming because it alows me to expres my
        creativety and create applications. I like long walks because it ease my mind and is a good
        way to stay in shape without to much effort. I also like games, the ide of experiencing a
        world not confined by the laws of reality is fascinating to me.

        I take a lot of inspiration from Buddhism. I believe the middle way, or what we in Sweden
        call "lagom", is the answer to many questions in our day-to-day life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mind is a little all over the place, so I implement structures in my life to not reflect
        that. therefore, these structures are important to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies consist of game design, speedruns and (most importantly) creating. Whether it's
        the DnD character I'll never get to use or a full-scale game doesn't matter. I constantly
        get new ideas and creating them allows me to stop thinking about it.
