          <strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>I worked for the department that developed a
          recruitment platform. Their codebase is a culmination of years of work from many different
          people. therefore, I quickly learned to read legacy-code, write scalable code and to
          collaborate with colleagues in different roles. The cases assigned to me were everything
          from obscure bugs to my own modals. If you, the reader, use ReachMe. I can happily say
          that I'm the one who created the modal you used to add me to the system.

          <strong>Company:&nbsp;</strong>Customer First is a smaller B2B company that provides a
          communication platform with phone, mail, chatts and a lot of focus on customizability.

        <li>
          <strong>Skills:&nbsp;</strong>Javascript, Vue, Vuex, React Native, jQuery, SQL, Node.js,
          WebSocket, Git, JWT.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cases:&nbsp;</strong>It started with smaller features, joining customer meetings
          and listening in on planning sessions. After three months I got my own client. This gave
          me the opportunity to be part of a real project from beginning to end. My most important
          lesson was to know my own ability. I use that knowledge to help clients understand what is
          possible, how much resources a feature will require and (most importantly) be able to
          provide better alternatives.
