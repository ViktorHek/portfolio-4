      <br />
      <p>
        The core theme is "gamification". I find normal portfolios quite boring and wanted to create
        something fun. Given that this portfolio is a representation of me, the rest of the styling
        decisions are based on personal preference.
      </p>

        <strong>Doodles</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The doodles represent me. Like all other humans, I have many sides, but most of them are
        quite similar, and most of them are feeling okay. There is a political message behind my
        art. It's okay to just feel okay. When we ask each other how we feel, "just okay" is seen as
        a negative response that calls for a follow-up question. The background is a happy, colorful
        image and only one of the characters is smiling. This is the idea. Not being happy is not
        the same as being sad. and I want to express that.
      </p>
      <br />

        <strong>Windows</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The pop-up windows are a representation of how my mind works. Cluttered, unorganized but
        packed with ideas, projects and information that interest me. Some windows might seem random
        and out of place. But this is (for better or worse) what occupies my mind every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, I always have a ton of tabs open. The user's ability to minimize and move the
        windows around is to imitate my structuring process. it's possible, you just have to put in
        a little bit of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is very little styling when it comes to everything inside these windows. That's a
        flex. Very few people can design something that looks good with default HTML. I
        take pride in being one of those few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: I had an idea to add a function that opens a random window at random intervals.
        But desided it would be to annoying for the user
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Game</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is pretty self-explanatory. I know most people don't care about me or who I am. So
        I try to trigger the user into learning about me, not because they care how I am, but
        because they want to win.
      </p>
      <p>So if you read this, I win.</p>
