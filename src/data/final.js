        Congratulations! You have found all my doodles and should now have a better understanding of
        who I am and what I'm capable of. I honestly didn't think anyone would come this far. But
        you should of course be compensated for all your work. I will give you even more information
        about me and the ability to hire me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My "alter ego" (or whatever you call it) is "Hans Haydn". If you call me "Hans", I will know
        that you actually took the time to go through my portfolio. This will give you a tremendous
        advantage when hiring me. If I'm forced to pick between two good jobs, I will pick the one
        that shows the most interest in me.
