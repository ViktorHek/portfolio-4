      <h2>What Happend to the Dwemer?</h2>
      <br />
      <h4>Backstory</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The dwemer, or deep-elves, was a remnants of the early aldmer. They are well known for their
        skill and revolutionary developments in technology, engineering, crafting methods,
        metalwork, stonework, architecture, city-planning, science, mathematics, magic, and the
        academic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the greates dwemer to ever live was Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac. Tonal
        Architecture is unique to the dwemer people. Many people know that the world is the result
        of a conversation between the two gods Anu and Padomay. But the tonal architectures are the
        only ones that knows how to manipulate the voises of the gods to reconstuct reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dwemer where never fond of the gods and the ide of being destroyed if Anus and Padomays
        conversation reached it's conclution sure must have scared them. When the dwemers found the
        heart of Lorkan, the dead god, Lord Kagrenac started working on the biggest technological
        advansment in the history of Mundus. With the power to manipulate the voice of gods, Lord
        Kagremac built a one thousand feet tall automaton that would use the heart of Lorkan as it's power source.
        Lord Kagrenac built Numidium, the brass God of destruction. But when the Numidium was
        activated, a dragonend started and all the dwemer disapperad. Everyone exept one, Yagrum
        Bagarn, he was in oblivion at the time (this will de relevant leater). This occured
        thousands of years ago and no one have heard anything about was heppend to the dwemer.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h4>What happend?</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are two common theories and I think both are wrong. the first one is called zero-sum.
        The theory is that by the power of the Numidium and trough global communication system, all
        dwemer reached was is called chim and reliced that they are just a dream in the god-head.
        When reaching chim there are two outcomes. You relice thet you don't actually exist and
        disappear or you relice thet you don't actually need to exist and you become a god. I don't
        like this theory because the dwemer already knew that they where the result of a
        conversation. The relication that they don't really exist should not be that surpricing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second theory is that the dwemer became "the skin of the Numidium". Lord Kagrenac was
        very patriotic and would never to something to destroy his people. And he's to smart to not
        see this as a posible side effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two theorys above are based on the ide that the disappearance of the dwemer was a
        failure. My theory is that the dwemer succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole point of creating the Numidium was in order to not be depended on the gods. Both
        Mundus and oblivion will cease to exist if the conversation between Anu and Padomay stops. I
        believe Lord Kagrenac reliced that the only way to get away from the gods was to travle
        outside of both mundus and oblivion, to "The Gray Maybe". The Numidium was never intended to
        destroy material things (even though it could, see Tiber Septims conquest over the Aldmeri
        Dominion of the Summerset Isles.) The Numidium was intended to destroy the walls beween
        mundus and "The Gray Maybe".
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why we have never heard of an dwemer is because they live in an dimention that no
        one else has visitet. The reason why Yagrum Bagarn is still here is because the Numidium
        created an opening between mundus and "The Gray Maybe" witch was not conected to oblivion.
        This theory also explains how Tiber Septim manage to defeat the military superior Aldmeri
        Dominion in less then an hour. He didn't (really) defeat them, he teleported them to "The
        Gray Maybe".
