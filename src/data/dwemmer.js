        <p>
          The dwemer, or deep-elves, was a remnant of the early aldmer. They are well known for
          their skill and revolutionary developments in technology, engineering, crafting methods,
          metalwork, stonework, architecture, city planning, science, mathematics, magic, and the
          academic arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the greatest dwemer to ever live was Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac. Tonal
          Architecture is unique to the dwemer people. Many people know that the world is the result
          of a conversation between the two gods Anu and Padomay. But the tonal architectures are
          the only ones that know how to manipulate the voises of the gods to reconstruct reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dwemer was never fond of the gods and the idea of being destroyed if Anus and Padomays
          conversation reached its conclusion sure must have scared them. When the dwemers found the
          heart of Lorkan, the dead god, Lord Kagrenac started working on the biggest technological
          advancement in the history of Mundus. With the power to manipulate the voice of gods, Lord
          Kagremac built a one thousand feet tall automaton that would use the heart of Lorkan as
          its power source. Lord Kagrenac built Numidium, the brass God of destruction. But when the
          Numidium was activated, a dragonend started and all the dwemer disappeared. Everyone
          except one, Yagrum Bagarn. He was in oblivion at the time (this will be relevant later).
          This occured thousands of years ago and no one has heard anything about what happened to
          the dwemer.

        <p>
          There are two common theories and I think both are wrong. the first one is called
          zero-sum. The theory is that by the power of the Numidium and through their global
          communication system, all dwemer reached chim and realised that they are just a dream in
          the god-head. When reaching chim there are two outcomes. You realize that you don't
          actually exist and disappear or you realize that you don't actually need to exist and you
          become a god. I don't like this theory because the dwemer already knew that they were the
          result of a conversation. The realization that they don't really exist should not be that
          surprising.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second theory is that the dwemer became "the skin of the Numidium". Lord Kagrenac was
          very patriotic and would never do something to destroy his people. And he's to smart too
          not see this as a possible side effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two theories above are based on the idea that the disappearance of the dwemer was a
          failure. My theory is that the dwemer succeeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole point of creating the Numidium was in order to not be dependent on the gods.
          Both Mundus and oblivion will cease to exist if the conversation between Anu and Padomay
          stops. I believe Lord Kagrenac realized that the only way to get away from the gods was to
          travel outside of both mundus and oblivion, to "the gray maybe". The Numidium was never
          intended to destroy material things (even though it could, see Tiber Septims conquest over
          the Aldmeri Dominion of the Summerset Isles.) The Numidium was intended to destroy the
          walls between mundus and "the gray maybe".
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why we have never heard of a dwemer is because they live in a dimention that no
          one else has visited. The reason why Yagrum Bagarn is still here is because the Numidium
          created an opening between mundus and "the gray maybe" which was not connected to
          oblivion. This theory also explains how Tiber Septim managed to defeat the military
          superior Aldmeri Dominion in less than an hour. He didn't (really) defeat them, he
          teleported them to "The Gray Maybe".
