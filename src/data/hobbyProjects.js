        <strong>Talentech internship:&nbsp;</strong>I woked for the depatment that developed a
        recruitment platform. Their codebase is a culmination of year of work from many differant
        people. therefore, i quickly learned to read legasy-code, whrite scalable code and to
        collaborate with colleagues in different roles. The cases assigned to me where everything
        between obscure buggs to my own modals. If you, the reader, uses ReachMe. I can happily say
        that I'm the one who created the modal you use to add me to the system.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cases:&nbsp;</strong>It started with smaller features, joining customer meetings and
        listening in on planning sessions. After three month I got my own client. This gave me the
        opportunity to be part of a real project from begining to end. My most important lesson was
        to know my onw ability. I use that knowledge to help clients understand what is posible, how
        much resources a feature will require and (most importanty) be able to provide better
        alternatives.
