          <strong>Talentech internship:&nbsp;</strong>I worked for the department that developed a
          recruitment platform. Their codebase is a culmination of years of work from many different
          people. therefore, I quickly learned to read legacy code, write scalable code and to
          collaborate with colleagues in different roles. The cases assigned to me were everything
          from obscure bugs to my own modals. If you, the reader, use ReachMe. I can happily say
          that I'm the one who created the modal you used to add me to the system.
