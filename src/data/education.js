            <strong>Talentech internship:&nbsp;</strong>I worked for the department that developed a
            recruitment platform. Their codebase is a culmination of years of work from many
            different people. therefore, I quickly learned to read legacy code, write scalable code
            and to collaborate with colleagues in different roles. The cases assigned to me were
            everything from obscure bugs to my own modals. If you, the reader, use ReachMe. I can
            happily say that I'm the one who created the modal you used to add me to the system.
