        <strong>Talentech internship:&nbsp;</strong>I woked for the depatment that developed a
        recruitment platform. Their codebase is a culmination of year of work from many differant
        people. therefore, i quickly learned to read legasy-code, whrite scalable code and to
        collaborate with colleagues in different roles. The cases assigned to me where everything
        between obscure buggs to my own modals. If you, the reader, uses ReachMe. I can happily say
        that I'm the one who created the modal you use to add me to the system.
