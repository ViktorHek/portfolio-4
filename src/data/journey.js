          I grew up curious and wanted to try different careers before settling on one. Resulting in
          a broad education, media & communication science. Found programming by sheer coincidence
          through YouTube. Witch led me to a course where I learned everything I needed to further
          educate myself. As soon as I got my first job as a full-stack developer. I stopped looking
          for what to do with my life and decided to dedicate it to creating code.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started working I had 12 weeks of education. After three months I got my own client
          that I was responsible for. I'm very grateful for the trust they put in me. Based on my
          work, they concluded that I had the capability to handle my own client. The pressure got
          to me and when more job requirement was added to me, I folded. Six months after my
          employment I was supposed to have a meeting with the boss and talk about my cases, salary
          and work tasks. I saw that as a good opportunity to discuss my problems. But my boss
          canceled the meeting so my cases, salary and work tasks were decided without my input. I
          asked about the meeting to no avail. I resigned shortly after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to hit the books. They say that the more you know about something, the more you
          realize that you don't know anything. I knew I had a lot to learn and thanks to my
          internship at Talentech, I did. It's a company with a full-scale development team. Packed
          with competent back-end/front-end developers, UX designers, QA testers and I was a sponge
          in the middle absorbing everything I could learn. My main takeaway from Talentech is how
          to work with other people. When it comes to both my hobby project and my work experience I
          was used to creating code that works for me and makes sense to me. Talentech taught me how
          to create code that makes sense for someone else 5 years in the future. They gave me the
          structure and mindset that is required when working with other people.

          I'm currently looking for employment, have you seen him? But I also try to enjoy the time
          I get to spend on my hobby projects.

          My dream is to become something I call a full-full-stack developer. Someone who knows
          front-end, back-end and a little bit of everything regarding code. I strongly believe that
          my knowledge in back-end development has improved me as a front-end developer. That
          concept on steroids is someone who can create a fully featured application by himself.
          That's me in maybe 20 years. I have no desire to do big solo projects, I just want to be
          able to do them.

        When I grew up, I didn't know what I wanted to be. I liked working with others. So I decided
        on a broad education with social aspects, media & communication science. But in the back of
        my head, I always had a dream of working with creating stuff using my skills and
        imagination. It never seemed like a realistic career choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        By sheer coincidence, I was introduced to programming through YouTube. I found a course
        where I learned everything i needed to further educate myself. When I got my first job as a
        full-stack developer, I realized that my dream of building a career on my creations became a
        reality. In my opinion, creating a good-looking webpage with cohesive functionality is a
        form of art.
      </p>
      <p>
        I resigned from that job, let me explain. When I started working i had 12 weeks of
        education. After three months I got my own client that I was responsible for. A year before
        that, I didn't even know what an array was. I'm very grateful for the trust they put in me.
        Based on my work, they concluded that I had the capability to handle my own client. The
        pressure got to me and when even more job requirement was added to me, I folded. Six months

        After that, I hit the books. They say that the more you know about something, the more you
        realize that you don't know anything. I knew I had a lot to learn and thanks to my
        internship at Talentech, I sure did. Now I'm looking forward to my new dream of becoming a
        full-full-stack developer, someone who can do anything.
