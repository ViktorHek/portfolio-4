      When I grew up, I didn't know what I wanted to be. I liked working with others. So i desided
      on a broad education with social aspects, media & communication-science. But in the back of my
      head I allways had an dream of working with creating stuff using my skills and imagination. It
      never seemed like a realistisc career choice.

      By sheer coincidence, i was introduced to programming trough YouTube. I found a course where I
      learned everything i needed to futher educate myself. When I got my first jobb as a full-stack
      developer, I reliced that my dream of building a career on my creations became a reality. In
      my opinion, creating a good looking webpage with a cohesive functionality, is an form of art.

      I resigned from that job, let me explain. When I started working i had 12 weeks of education.
      After three month I got my own client that I was responsible for. A year before that, i didn't
      even know what an array was. I'm very grateful for the trust they put in me. Based on my work,
      they concluded that I hade the capability to handle my own client. The pressure got to me and
      when even more job requirement was added to me, I folded. Six month after my employment I was
      suposed to have a meeting with the boss and talk about my cases, salary and work tasks. I saw
      that as a good opportunity to discuss my problems. But my boss canceled the meeting so my
      cases, salary and work tasks was desided without my input. I asked for a new meeting to no
      avail. I resigned shortly after that.

      After that I hit the books. They say that the more you know about something, the more you
      realize that you don't know anything. I knew I had a lot to learn and thanks to my internship at Talentech, I sure did. 
      Now I'm looking forwards to my new dream of becoming a full-full-stack developer, someone that can do anything.
